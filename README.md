Thermostat Peripheral
=====================
*Still designing 'n' that*

Things that need doing
----------------------

- [ ] Finding a thermocouple component worthy of accurately determining the temperature of a room.
- [ ] Use [Averclock](https://github.com/naggie/averclock) to help produce a timer for the Arduino mircocontroller.
- [ ] Develop a system that allows the microcontroller to communicate with a computer.
- [ ] Create a low cost battery and charging system for power cut protection.

Temperature Sensors
-------------------

- Can use TMP36 (I own one)
- [DS18B20 Digital Temp Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/245) Calibrated temperature readings. Temperature reading sent over data line as serial equivalent using [1-Wire](http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/OneWire) protocol.
